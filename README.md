Hey im HEB the numbers is the year I joined. If you need to reach me guess what you simply cant cuz well nah i dont really wanna be reached lol. So just deal with reading this ig

I work on a few things more recently getting into coding itself so ig some of that might be put up since it is useful.
I will basically make a repo for any new projects I work and I deem are good enough to be worth while for others to use so there will be lots of random applications and programs

I learnt a few languages well the basics of them so theres that and thats about it for me until i think of more to put
e.g 
Lua (Decent)
HTML (Decent)
CSS (Decent)
Python (Moderate)
Assembly (Little)
JS (Decent)
C++ (Little)

So thats me HEB, if you need me you cant contact me easily lol
